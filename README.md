# Angular To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do List application built with Angular. It allows users to add, remove, and persist tasks using browser local storage. The application is built with modern Angular practices, including the use of components, two-way data binding, and services.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is modular, with a dedicated `TodoListComponent` to manage and display tasks.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Implemented using `[(ngModel)]` to ensure that the view and model are synchronized, allowing for dynamic task management.
- **Service for Task Management**: A `TaskService` is used to handle task operations, centralizing the logic for adding, retrieving, and deleting tasks.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks persist even after page refreshes or browser restarts.
